# 📌 Overview

StudExa is a centralized platform designed for colleges and universities to digitally manage student achievements.

Instead of maintaining spreadsheets or paper records, students can submit achievements online, faculty members verify submissions, and administrators manage point rules through a single dashboard.

The system automatically awards points based on predefined achievement categories and maintains a leaderboard to encourage student participation.
